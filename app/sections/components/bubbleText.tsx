        3. How long should it be? <br />
        4. Is there anything specific you want them to learn or be able to do by
        the end?

        the plan even better. Would you like me to ask them, or get your lesson
        plan now?

      <p>
        I’m missing a few key details to make this really clear and helpful.
        Here’s what I still need:
      </p>,
      <p>
        • Which Fortune 500 company do you want to look at? <br />• Do you have
        a specific time period in mind (like Q1 2023), or need help picking one?
        <br />• What kind of analysis are you looking for (like revenue, profit,
        or market share)? <br />• How would you like it presented (a quick
        summary, charts, tables, etc.)?
      </p>,

        Apple, I want the earnings from the past 5 years. A line chart that
        charts revenue, operating income, and net profit over time.

      <p>
        Got it! You’d like a line chart showing Apple’s revenue, operating
        income, and net profit over the last five years to spot trends. Hang
        tight while I pull that together!
