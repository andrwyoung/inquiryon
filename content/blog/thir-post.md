# Will My Customers Hate Me If I Add a Credit Card Surcharge?

#payzone/articles

This is the #1 question I hear from business owners the moment they learn about surcharging. **You're not alone.**

In this article we're going to talk about:

1. Why you should even consider surcharge
2. What surcharging even is
3. What your customers will actually think
   - How about **high-ticket** items?
4. How to introduce surcharge without losing customers

## Why Surcharge?

Every month, businesses like yours **pay hundreds (even thousands) in fees.** That adds up. From the time you started your business, you might have paid tens of thousands in fees. Just on this alone.

That's money you can be using to repair that window you've been saving up for. Or covering the cost of all your software. Or even buying yourself a day off.

You're busy, and running a business is tough.

So what could you do with that cash if you **didn't have to raise your prices** by a single cent?

If you’re tired of covering the cost, there’s a another way.

## What is Surcharge?

Surcharge is simply **giving the customers a choice**. And giving you a way to stop eating fees.

Right now, you don't have a choice. You have to cover the cost of every single card swipe, from a $5 transaction to $5000 one.

Surcharging doesn’t force anything. It just lets customers choose how they want to pay:

- If they pay in cash, check or zelle, they avoid a fee entirely.
- But if they choose credit for the added convenience, they’ll pay a small fee—totally up to them.

Done correctly, it's not a penalty or a surprise. Just transparency.

## What will my customers think?

Now this is the fear that most business owners have. And **it's completely valid.**

You worked hard to build trust. And your customers are the reason that you exist. You don't want to anger them right?

But to tell you the truth: Done correctly, **most customers don't mind it at all.** And more importantly, most keep coming back.

As business owners, you know that customers may say one thing, but how they spend tells the real story. And the numbers say this:

- Already 1 in 3 merchants already use surcharging, and that number is growing fast. If it were hurting businesses, that wouldn't be happening.
- 69% of customers have already encountered surcharging. **It's not new anymore**—it’s becoming normal.
- And if they don't want to pay the fee? Great! 41% of credit card users decide to pay with cash, Zelle, check or even ACH instead when given the choice. Win-win.

So yes, some customers might notice. But most won’t care.

One of our clients—a wholesale flower merchant—was nervous to roll out surcharging. She was sure her regulars would be upset. In the end? Only one customer complained—walked out, then came right back with cash. That same customer is still a regular today.

Now she just puts up a simple sign, explains it kindly when needed, and saves thousands a year without losing a single loyal customer.

Because ultimately, **what they value is you** and the service you provide. And they keep coming back becuase of that.

### So what if I have high ticket items?

So you're thinking: "My invoices are in the thousands. A 3% fee on $5,000 is $150! That’s a huge ask for a customer."

And you're exactly right, which is why surcharging works in your favor.

The point of Surcharging is not that you force customers pay that fee. It's to incentivize them so that **no one has to pay** it.

Because the $150 doesn't go away. You're just currently paying it. For everyone.

But the customer is thinking the same thing you are: "I don't want to pay $150!"
So they don't pay it: "I'll just write a check. Or send a Zelle"

And just like that, you **both avoid the fee** without raising prices.

High ticket industries already do this:

- Apartment complexes
- Dentists
- Law Firms
  And they accept payment mostly through ACH, cash or check.

Because for high-ticket items, customers are far more willing to switch payments methods to save a noticable fee. So you **don't have to lose the money**, nor does the customer.

So the real question is:
Is presenting that choice worth saving thousands each month?

## How to transition?

Surcharging can feel **like a big step**. Especially if you've never done anything like it before.
"How do I tell my customers? What’s legally allowed? How do you even start?"
