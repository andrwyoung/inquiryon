# Amplifyo Suggestions

> "Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another." Proverbs 27:17

## Honest Take

At its core, Amplifyo works like a smart layer **on top of ChatGPT** (and other LLMs)—helping users organize their marketing thoughts and auto-generate content without needing to prompt manually.

It seems to be more of a marketing-focused **note-taking system** with AI integration. So teams can organize marketing ideas and use those notes to generate content like blog posts.

From where I’m standing, here are the biggest gaps I currently see:

1. Over-reliance on AI as the differentiator
2. Friction-heavy onboarding and UI
3. Conscience concerns around guidance

Of course, there may be a lot I don't see, and you have a lot of plans and big things coming, so feel free to take what’s helpful and leave the rest!

### 1. Over-Reliance on AI as Differentiator

The most helpful feature right now is the website data puller. It extracts customer segments and value props, which is genuinely useful. But:

- I could replicate the same results if I used ChatGPT to pull data from my website and tell it to write me a blog post.

* Saving and editing this data is helpful, but it's functionally similar to writing things down in a Google Doc or Notion.

AI can but should not be **solely** relied on to create final content

- AI is not yet consistent enough to carry tone and intention across a full campaign.

* Even with good prompt engineering. AI generated content is still generic and recognizable (just ask the college students that use it for essays)
* It still needs the human touch of someone with skilled writing/marketing judgement to feel aligned and compelling.
* Also, if everyone is generating content with AI, how does a brand stand out?

Like Niki said, right now the competition isn’t another SaaS — it’s just not using the tool.
ChatGPT and Notion are free, and for many users, that’s “good enough.”

### 2. Friction in the UI

The most noticeable product pain is the number of fields and checkboxes users must complete before seeing value.

I get the intent: these forms act like a mini marketing coach, forcing clarity. I think that's really valuable!

But from a UX perspective, it **feels like homework.**

- The onboarding should emphasize what’s _required vs optional_.

* There should be incentives tied to completing fields:
  - Example, by filling out your USP "You increased campaign clarity by 30%!”\*
* The system needs to reward and guide — not overwhelm.

But the good news is that it's relatively straightfoward to fix this.

### 3. Conscience Issues With AI Guidance

For users with marketing knowledge, Amplifyo is genuinely helpful—it speeds up execution.
But for a user with 0 marketing experience, I'm a bit skeptical and morally torn to present this tool to them.

I personally wouldn’t feel comfortable letting AI run an **entire** marketing campaign.

Even if the outcome looks good, the _possibility_ of offering false confidence bothers me. I myself wouldn’t let AI build a campaign for me without being heavily involved...and I wouldn’t feel right asking others to either.

You’ve said it yourself: people don’t know where to start with marketing.

- But they don’t just need to be told what to do. They need to understand **why.**

# Recommendations

In my judgement, Amplifyo must (1) be easier to onboard, and (2) give sound judgement.

### 1. Easier Onboarding

- Consider just automatically importing their website in the beginning
- Agressively cut down to text
  - The tutorial is fun to read, but more wordy

* Agressively cut down on fields/forms
  - In particular, the Sign Up page should really be like 3-4 fields
  - Clarify what’s optional vs required
  - Also, the Affliates, Investors and Media forms could be condensed into Contact Us, or be more hidden.

- Gamify or reward data entry (e.g. completion = increased clarity score)
- Consider progressive disclosure (only show what's needed)

### 2. Clearer, Trustworthy Judgment

Right now Amplifyo sits in a muddy middle. AI offers suggestions, but I wouldn't allow users to fully trust it.

The way I see it, there are three paths forward:
**Path 1: Lean Into Human Judgment**
Simply lean into your consulting background and guide users on how to best use these tools **tailored to them**:

- Easiest path because you already provide this somewhat
- You have such deep and rich experience consulting already
  But:
- It's not very scalable
- It risks just becoming another agency

**Path 2: Lean into Education**
Make the user interface extremely easy to navigate, and become an education and planning platform for people with 0 marketing experience. Not to execute tasks, but to learn while doing:

- Again, tap into your consulting experience
- Make the platform feel like a guided course + planner, not just a tool
- Idea: “here’s why this step matters,” not just “fill this in"
- You not to far from having a platform to do this honestly.
- Don't need to be as involved as Path 1
  But:
- Have to make content (but maybe this is a plus for you)
- Must find way to keep people around, else churn rate will be high
  Are you interested in being an interactive marketing school?

**Path 3: Lean Into Data + Statistical Feedback**
Integrate with _everything_, and then leverage **hard statistical data** to provide Guidance

- The most scalable and defendable path
- Differentitate yourself from everyone by becoming the central hub for market performance
- Leverage AI ethically by just helping you understand data you already have, not guiding blindly:
  - Track post engagement
  * Run A/B tests on CTA wording
  * Recommend best timing/angles based on past results
    But
- This path is hard (maybe why no one is doing it)
- Integrations are messy, and data standardization is no small feat.
  What are the biggest barriers you’ve run into when thinking about integrations?

If you want my opinion. I like path 2. If you're up for it, it's a good balance of scalability and differentiability without sacrificing the human touch. I think path 3 will be the "most successful" but do you **need** to run a billion dollar company?

## Final Thoughts

Amplifyo is a genuinely cool product! There’s a solid foundation and a strong team behind it (you guys are really a great duo).

Again, feel free to take what you will.

These notes are offered in the spirit of sharpening, not simply to be critical or pessimistic. I like what you stand for and want to see you succeed. I am super excited for what you have in store!
