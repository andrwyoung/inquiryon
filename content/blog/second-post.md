# Inquiryon Contract Review

Looks good! Main thing is that since I'm doing custom drawings, I want to maintain ownership of those (I'm very stingy about that in all my contracts lol).
Also want to define the exact scope of the project and the deliverables needed to fulfill the Partnership.

### Contract Review

- Article A: let's define the scope of Services. Here's my idea (note the exclusion of Figma or sketches/supporting documents in final deliverable):

```
Consultant will provide design and creative support for the Companyâ€™s web presence, including:
* Branding definition and style guidelines
* Development of an interactive prototype using Figma
* Copywriting services for on-site text content
* Creation of custom illustrations and visual assets for web use
* Frontend development and coding of the actual website
* Ongoing collaboration with the Founder to refine and iterate on visual concepts and execution
Consultant agrees to deliver **the final code** for the website landing page, along with all relevant front-end assets, as well as a Company branding guideline, and hereby grants the Company the right to use, publish, and modify such deliverables as needed, subject to the IP ownership terms outlined in this Agreement.
```

- 2a + 2e:
  - (very important) Retain **full ownership** for any **original drawings/illustrations and sketches** that I create for this project (should just be like 4 or 5 drawings) excluding logo and branding elements. It will **not be a part of the Company IP** nor be owned despite being a part of the deliverables. I'm just drawing these for fun, so don't want to be giving it away.
  - (less important) Figma file will be under IP, but since it is not under deliverables, it is still under my ownership. Idk. Can you write this in somehow?
  - Note: Logo and Branding (+branding guideline) will under IP and your ownership
  - Note: Code itself will be under IP and your ownership
- 2c: Let's just keep it at "during period of Relationship"
- 2f: (very important) **Perpetual, non-exclusive right** to showcase my **all** work (Figma, drawings, logo, sketches, branding, website screenshots, and code repositories etc.) for **portfolio and self-promotional purposes** in all forms of media. Not just for one year.
- 4: lol I just thought this section was funny
- 8: note to make sure we incorporate anything about my drawings not being under the IP here
- If you wanted to include a due date that would be fine too....but it's ok if not. I'm on a personal time limit anyways (the time limit of always being on the grind heh)
